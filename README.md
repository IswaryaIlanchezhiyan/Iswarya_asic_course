        Introduction to iverilog design testbench
    </summary>

    

**Simulator:**

It is a a device that enables the operator to reproduce or represent under test conditions phenomena likely to occur in actual performance.
iverilog is the simulator used for this course.

**How Simulator works**

- Simulator looks for the change in the values of input.
* Upon change to the input,output is evaluated.

**iverilog:**

Icarus Verilog is a compiler that translates Verilog source code into executable programs for simulation.

**iverilog based simulation flow**

**Testbench:**

A conventional Verilog testbench is a code module that describes the stimulus to a logic design and checks whether the design's outputs match its specification.

**1.Introduction to Labs**

Lab setup is made using the following link:

```

```

**2.Introduction to iverilog gtkwave**

A 2Ã—1 multiplexer is used as an example for explaining how iverilog and gtkwave works.It initially creates a a.out file which eventually opened a dumpfile(tb_good_mux.vcd) for producing output.

The following commands are used for producing output:

```
$ iverilog  good_mux.v  tb_good_mux.v
$ ./a.out
$ gtkwave tb_good_mux.vcd

```

        Introduction to Yosys and Logic Synthesis
    </summary>
    
**Introduction to Yosys**

**Logic Synthesis**

RTL to gate level translation is called as synthesis.The design is converted into gates and connections are made between gates.This is given as a file called netlist.


**Synthesizer:**

Synthesizer is the tool used for synthesis.
Synthesis in VLSI is the process of converting your code (program) into a circuit. In terms of logic gates, synthesis is the process of translating an abstract design into a properly implemented chip. Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) are specific programming languages that are used to explain the hardware of a circuit.
Yosys is used as synthesizer in this course.


**Netlist:**

Netlist is also a description of a design written using a HDL code when it is written in an RTL style.The netlist is then supposed to perform the same function as the corresponding HDL code. The netlist out of the synthesis tool is fed into layout tools to produce the layout of the chip.

**RTL Design**
RTL (register-transfer level) design is a hardware design methodology that describes the behavior of digital circuits in terms of the flow of data between registers, and the operations that are performed on that data as it moves through the circuit.

**.lib**

A standard cell library is a collection of well defined and appropriately characterized logic gates that can be used to implement a digital design.The library files contain different flavours of standard gate which maybe like 2 input or 3 input gate with slower or medium or faster version of it.
